Information Assurance Finals project by:
- Carl Cyruz Leonador
- Rolando Peri√±a

## Project Overview
The project implements a prototype of an access control system designed for small organizations.
The system is built as a web application using Python and Flask, demonstrating key features such as user authentication, role-based access control, and basic identity management.
The web application uses HTML Jinja templates, and Bootstrap5 for styling.

The system makes use of a SQLite database to store user information. Security measures were implemented to keep the application secure from malicious actors.

Additional features implemented include: Password Policies, Audit Logging, Advanced RBAC, User Activity Monitoring, and Automated Backup System.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Launch XAMPP (or other SQLite Database server client).
3. Import the database in the `instance` directory.
4. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. You can install it via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the web application by running the `app.py` Python file.
6. Access the web application by visiting http://localhost:8080/.
